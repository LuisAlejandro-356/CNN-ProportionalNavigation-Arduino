# CNN-ProportionalNavigation-arduino
A CNN is developed in TensorFlow to classify aircraft using LiDAR-based grayscale images. An interception algorithm based on 3D Generalized Proportional Navigation (GPN) is implemented with dual Runge-Kutta integration. The full system runs on an Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect.
